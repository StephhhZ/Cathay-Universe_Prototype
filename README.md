# Cathay Universe  
Team E146 – Wonder4  

A one-stop, AI-powered mileage lifestyle ecosystem for mainland China, built on Cathay's Asia Miles assets.

---

## 1. Overview

Cathay Universe is a unified mileage redemption platform that turns Asia Miles into a cross-scenario lifestyle currency.

Instead of using miles only for flights or limited partners, Cathay Universe lets users redeem across:

- High-end travel and hospitality
- Dining, retail and shopping
- Wellness and sports
- Arts, culture and entertainment
- ESG and charity experiences

The platform is designed specifically for the digital habits and payment ecosystems of mainland Chinese users.

## 2. Background and Problem

### Situation

- Mature Asia Miles loyalty system with a large member base and 800+ partners.
- Strong rebound in travel and consumption.
- Widespread adoption of digital payments in mainland China.

### Complication

Despite these advantages, Cathay's mileage ecosystem is not well integrated with:

- Mainland digital platforms (mini-programs, digital wallets, shopping apps, points alliances).
- High-frequency, daily lifestyle scenarios.
- Local loyalty expectations, leading to low awareness and limited touchpoints.

### Core Question

How can we redesign mileage usage so that it:

- Fits mainland China’s digital consumption patterns,
- Maximizes the value of miles,
- And builds a sustainable, high-frequency relationship with users?

## 3. Solution: Cathay Universe

Cathay Universe addresses the above through four core pillars:

### 3.1 Mileage Everywhere – Full-Spectrum Redemption

Enable miles to be redeemed across:

- Premium travel products and packages  
- High-end hotels, dining and retail  
- Wellness and sports memberships  
- Arts, cultural events and curated experiences  

### 3.2 Flexible Redemption – “Miles Your Way”

- Hybrid payment (Miles + RMB) for low-mileage and new users.
- Low-threshold experience vouchers to attract non-regular Cathay travelers.
- ESG-aligned charity and public-welfare products.

### 3.3 AI “Privilege Recommendation”

An AI recommendation engine that:

- Learns user behavior and preferences.
- Calculates dynamic redemption values based on demand, seasonality, partner campaigns and inventory.
- Suggests “the most valuable way to use your miles now”.
- Predicts when users should “hold” or “spend” miles.

### 3.4 “Universe Auction Hall”

A premium auction experience offering:

- Rare travel experiences (e.g. new aircraft experiences, first flights, cockpit or captain experiences where permissible).
- VIP access to sports events, arts and cultural activities.
- Dynamic bidding suggestions powered by the same AI engine.
